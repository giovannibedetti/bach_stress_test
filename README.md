 README!
 
 This is a stress test (originally written for Processing) for p5.js and Web Audio API.
 At mouse click the image will be divided in 4 images.
 Also the audio file will be split in 4 parts and these will be played together. Parts 1 and 3 will play forward, while parts 2 and 4 will play backwards.
 
 You'll see and hear 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024 images and sounds together. (256 seems to be the highest value on Chrome 55.0.2883.95 64-bit)
 
 The theme is the famous J.S. Bach canon 1 Ã  2 from the "Musical Offering" (1747)
 This piece is a "crab canon", so it can be played at the same time forward and backward.
 See here (http://www2.nau.edu/tas3/MOcancrizans.pdf) for the full story.
 This test was made just to find out if it can be combined in other ways. 
 
 Check out the magic of math.
 
 Desktop only: 
 for your pleasure you can stop the sounds using the space bar, 
 and enable/disable the random image change pressing 's'.
 
 Warning: as I said, this is a stress test. Try it at your own risk! (your browser can hang a little bit)
 
 If your browser supports Web Audio API, you will hear the full Bach theme on load. On iOS devices, this could not be true, because autoplay is disabled.
